# CanalBot
A small Python script ~~not the best written~~ made to automate the addition of weekly anime episodes on my server, withe the help of a certain RSS page on a cat torrent website.
Originally made to work on a **linux** server, with [JellyFin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin), Plex or other Streaming service

## Requirements :
- Python 3.7 at least (support is not assured for older versions)
- a [qBittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent) Web UI, **hosted on the same machine as the script** (use qBittorrent-nox on servers)
- [HandBrakeCLI](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake) installed on your linux distro (dpkg, not the flatpack version)
- [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser), a python module
- [python-qBittorrent](https://github.com/v1k45/python-qBittorrent), another python module

### Install all requirements :
```
apt-get install python3
apt-get install qbittorrent-nox
apt-get install handbrake-cli
pip3 install feedparser
pip3 install python-qbittorrent
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```

## What does this script do ?
It will check for new episodes in the RSS every 7 minutes *(exactly 7 minutes to avoid getting tempban from DNS servers or Nyaa)* and if it finds one, it will download and encode *(you can choose between encoding or copying the file)* the episode to the selected location

**This script was intended to work with Erai-raws's torrents, giving the script another RSS feed will break the script.**
Sadly, is currently limited to adding only the first season of an anime, as Erai-Raws doesn't specify the season in their episode releases (I'm working to add a way to specify the season number in anime_list.txt THANKS ERAI-RAWS üëèüëè)

Default encoding settings *(~500MB ouput file size, for a ~24mn episode)*: 
- Bitrate : 2500kbps
- Audio Bitrate : 512kbps
- Subtitle : Hardub

*you can of course change the encoding settings, please refer to [HandBrakeCLI Documentation](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/cli/cli-options.html)*

## Usage guide :
- Install all dependencies
- Start qBitrorrent Web UI if it wasn't already
- Download the file `CanalBot.py` into a direcroty
- Create a file named `proceed_list.txt`, it will store the name of which files have already been encoded
- Create another file named `anime_list.txt`, and enter **ONE** keyword per anime, *see the [anime_list.txt example](https://github.com/YazZHh/CanalBot/blob/main/anime_list.txt)*
- Now edit CanalBot.py and modify the first variables included in the `settings` class to match your settings :
  * `delete_torrents_afterwards` if set to True, will delete permanently torrent file *(the downloaded one, not the file encoded or copied)* from disk and qBittorrent Web UI
  * `auto_encode` do what its name does, if set to True, it will automatically encode the file, however if set to False, it will just copy the file to the desired location
  * `lang` is used to choose the language of subtitles that will be burned in the video (you can choose to not burn the subtitles, see Customisation)
  * `suffix` define the end of the file. Episode name will be in this format : {anime_name}.s1e{episode_number}.{suffix}.mp4, for French subtitles you could put "vostfr" for instance.
  * `target_directory` tells the script where does the animes go
  * `torrents_location` define on which directory torrents are downloaded
  * `linuxuser` specify which linux user shoud own the files
  * `user` is the user of the qBittorrent Web UI
  * `password` is the password of the qBittorrent Web UI
  * `qb` set the link to the qBittorrent Web UI

- Now run the script in a screen on your linux server and that's it.
- If the script crashes, just restart it, it won't re-add episodes, or re-encode episode.

## Customisation
- You can custom the encoding command if you want, *see [HandBrakeCLI Documentation](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/cli/cli-options.html)*
- You can stop the script at any moment py pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, otherwise it will run infinitely
